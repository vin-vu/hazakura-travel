It is one of the country's 10 largest cities with a population of 1.5 million and a modern face.", "Although Kyoto is the centre of traditional Japan, it's also a modern city with concerte high-rises, numerous vending machines, and a vibrant food scene. But it's on a smaller more manageable scale than Tokyo and Osaka with plenty of green spaces, view of surrounding hills, and neighborhoods that feel like villages."]
